                But i&#039;ve used my black magic pocket cinema camera to shoot interviews, talking heads, home movies, travel videos, performance videos for me, the relatively small size makes it a serviceable travel camera. The blackmagic pocket cinema camera features an innovative and high speed usb‑c expansion port that operates at up to 5 gb/s. Although the osmo pocket will not require a fast memory card, it is still a good idea to buy memory cards with the proper specs to make sure everything is functioning correctly and reliably.
